# Live Analytics Front End

Front-end project for showing real-time reports for Vidiun live entries.
The project is based on AngularJS + Bootstrap, and uses a number of 3rd-party libraries for graphs, maps, etc. 

## Installation on Vidiun server
Unzip tag distributables to /opt/vidiun/apps/liveanalytics

## Running the project not through Vidiun VMC
This can be done for dev purposes - it uses un-minimized code, etc.

##### Option 1:
Edit app/index.html with relevant values (partner id, vs, etc), then navigate on your local host to this file

##### Option 2:
Navigate to the project's dashboard route on your localhost with the relevant params, ie <br>
http://localhost/app/#/dashboard/player=your_player_id|pid=your_partner_id|vs=your_vs|svc=service_url_no_protocol|cdn=cdn_host_no_protocol <br>
(note the pipes vs slashes) <br>
The provided values will override values hardcoded in app/index.html
